# Coding Guidelines

* Use UTF-8 as charset

* Use \n line endings

* Use 4 spaces, no tabs, to indent code

* Try to stick to the same consistant coding style (vertically aligned braces, a space after if, while, functions etc.):

    def function(arg1, arg2="text"):
        """Function description"""

        return True

* Try to require as few extra modules as possible
